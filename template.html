			<h2>Our History</h2>
				<p>
					Our first restaurant was first opened in AD 146 by Ima Purson and his third cousin thrice removed, Foo Bar, when they grew tired of eating the same thing, day in and out. The restaurant, then named Μπορείς να το φας;, was an immediate success. By AD 150, they opened their first subsidiary. 
					So began the humble beginnings of the largest restaurant chain in the known universe.
				</p>
				<p>
					In AD 162, Foo Bar came down with a then unknow disease, now know to be time-traveling smallpox. Foo Bar succumbed to the disease shortly thereafter, throwing Ima Purson into a deep depression. Μπορείς να το φας; started to struggle around this time as Ima Purson fell deeper and deeper into debt.
					Just before going bankrupt, Marcus Aurelius purchased the restaurants from Ima Purson for 12 billion drachmae in AD 164. The emperor grew bored of his side project after just five days and gave away the restaurant to the first beggar he found who still had all of his teeth. This person turned out to be Mannus Syphis.
				</p>
				<p>
					In AD 171 Mannus Syphis loaded his restaurants onto a trireme and sailed out to conquer America. By AD 172 Mannus was the first actual person to discover and inhabit America. By AD 179 Mannus opened six subsidiaries across the north-eastern United States. The next year he found the fountain of youth, allowing him to 
					rule Μπορείς να το φας; to this day. In AD 1773, after the Boston Tea Party, Mannus Syphis decided to change the name of the restaurant to You Can Eat That? to better mesh with the country’s  influx of English speakers. In AD 2009 and exclamation mark was added to the end of the name in an attempt to remain trendy.
					The number of restaurants in the chain continued to grow until it had well over one million in AD 2022.
